# izza

Yet another typecheck lib.

# Installation

    npm install izza
    
# Usage

While I am aware that there are many alternatives, I wanted something that would 
return a boolean false/true in synchronous mode, and a pretty formatted error when
invoked asynchrounous.

```javascript
const isa = require("izza/isa)


```
